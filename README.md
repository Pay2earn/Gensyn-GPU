# Run RL Swarm (Testnet) Node
RL Swarm is a fully open-source framework developed by GensynAI for building reinforcement learning (RL) training swarms over the internet. This guide walks you through setting up an RL Swarm node and a web UI dashboard to monitor swarm activity.

## Hardware Requirements
There are currently multiple swarms running on the Testnet, each training on a different data set. The current list of available models and swarms include:
* Models: `Qwen 2.5 0.5B`, `Qwen 2.5 1.5B`, `Qwen 2.5 7B`, `Qwen 2.5 32B (4 bit)` & `Qwen 2.5 72B (4 bit)`
* Swarms: `Math (GSM8K dataset)` & `Math Hard (DAPO-Math 17K dataset)`

Your hardware requirements will vary depending on which swarm and model you choose. Users with less powerful hardware should select a smaller model (e.g. Qwen 0.5B or 1.5B) and smaller dataset (GSM8K) `A`. Users with more powerful hardware can select a larger model (e.g. Qwen 7B, 32B or 72B) and larger dataset (DAPO-Math 17K) `B`. The requirements for each are listed below:

### Small model (0.5B or 1.5B) + Math (GSM8K dataset)
* `CPU-only`: arm64 or x86 CPU with minimum 16gb ram (note that if you run other applications during training it might crash training).

OR

* `GPU`: 
  * RTX 3090
  * RTX 4090
  * A100
  * H100
  * `≥24GB vRAM` GPU is recommended, but Gensyn now supports `>24GB vRAM` GPUs too.
  * `≥12.4` CUDA Driver

### Big model (7B, 32B or 72B) + Math Hard (DAPO-Math 17K dataset)
* `GPU`: A100 (80GB) or H100 (80GB)

## ✅ Update system and install required packages

```bash
# Update packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git screen && sudo apt upgrade -y

# download wget
sudo apt install wget
```
## 📦 Clone repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm/
cd rl-swarm
```

## 📥 Download the CPU-only installation script

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pay2earn/Gensyn-GPU/main/gpu-only.sh -O gpu-only.sh
chmod +x gpu-only.sh
```

## 🖥 Start a screen session to keep the process running in the background
```bash
screen -S swarm
```

## 🚀 Run the installer
```bash
./gpu-only.sh
```

* `Would you like to connect to the Testnet? [Y/n]` >>> Press `Y` to join testnet
* `Which swarm would you like to join (Math (A) or Math Hard (B))? [A/b]` >>> We have two type of Swarms:
  * `A`: Math (GSM8K dataset) -- Lower systems (>8GB) -- Use Small model (0.5B or 1.5B) for it.
  * `B`: Math Hard (DAPO-Math 17K dataset) -- Higher systems -- Use Big model (7B, 32B or 72B) for it.
* `How many parameters (in billions)? [0.5, 1.5, 7, 32, 72]` >>> `0.5` is minimal and `72` is very big model. Choose based on your system.
* Check Step [Hardware Requirement](https://github.com/0xmoei/gensyn-ai/blob/main/README.md#hardware-requirements) for more clue.

## 5) Login
**1- You have to receive `Waiting for userData.json to be created...` in logs**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/140f7d32-844f-4cf0-aac4-a91e9a14c1aa)

**2- Open login page in browser**
* **Local PC:** `http://localhost:3000/`
* **GPU Cloud Users:** Before conneting to your GPU, Add this flag: `-L 3000:localhost:3000` in front of your GPU's SSH Command, to be able to open `http://localhost:3000/` in your Local PC's browser.
* **VPS users:** You have to forward port by entering a command in the `Windows Powershell` of your local PC:
  * In windows start menu, Search **Windows Powershell** and open its terminal in your local PC.
  * Enter the command below and replace your vps ip with `Server_IP` and your vps port(.eg 22) with `SSH_PORT`
  ```
  ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 root@Server_IP -p SSH_PORT
  ```
  * ⚠️ Make sure you enter the command in your own local PC's Windows Powershell and NOT your VPS terminal.
  * This prompts you to enter your VPS password, when you enter it, you connect and tunnel to your vps
  * Now go to browser and open `http://localhost:3000/` and login

**3- Login with your preferred method**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f33ea530-b15f-4af7-a317-93acd8618a9f)

* After login, your terminal starts installation.

**4- Optional: Push models to huggingface**
* Enter your `HuggingFace` access token you've created when it prompted.
* This will need `2GB` upload bandwidth for each model you train, you can pass it by entering `N`.

---

### Node Name
* Now your node started running, Find your name after word `Hello`, like mine is `whistling hulking armadillo` as in the image below (You can use `CTRL+SHIFT+F` to search Hello in terminal)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1abdb1a-aa11-407f-8e5b-abe7d0a6b0f3)

---

### Screen commands
* Minimize: `CTRL` + `A` + `D`
* Return: `screen -r swarm`
* Stop and Kill: `screen -XS swarm quit`

---

## Backup
**You need to backup `swarm.pem`**.
### `VPS`:
Connect your VPS using `Mobaxterm` client to be able to move files to your local system. Back up these files:**
* `/root/rl-swarm/swarm.pem`

### `WSL`:
Search `\\wsl.localhost` in your ***Windows Explorer*** to see your Ubuntu directory. Your main directories are as follows:
* If installed via a username: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<your_username>`
* If installed via root: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\root`
* Look for `rl-swarm/swarm.pem`

### `GPU servers (.eg, Hyperbolic)`:
**1- Connect to your GPU server by entering this command in `Windows PowerShell` terminal**
```
sftp -P PORT ubuntu@xxxx.hyperbolic.xyz
```
* Replace `ubuntu@xxxx.hyperbolic.xyz` with your given GPU hostname
* Replace `PORT` with your server port (in your server ssh connection command)
* `ubuntu` is the user of my hyperbolic gpu, it can be ***anything else*** or it's `root` if you test it out for `vps`

Once connected, you’ll see the SFTP prompt:
```
sftp>
```

**2- Navigate to the Directory Containing the Files**
 * After connecting, you’ll start in your home directory on the server. Use the `cd` command to move to the directory of your files:
 ```
 cd /home/ubuntu/rl-swarm
 ```

**3- Download Files**
 * Use the `get` command to download the files to your `local system`. They’ll save to your current local directory unless you specify otherwise:
 ```
 get swarm.pem
 ```
* Downloaded file is in the main directory of your `Powershell` or `WSL` where you entered the sFTP command.
  * If entered sftp command in `Porwershell`, the `swarm.pem` file might be in `C:\Users\<pc-username>`.
* You can now type `exit` to close connection. The files are in the main directory of your `Powershell` or `WSL` where you entered the first SFTP command.

---

### Recovering Backup file (upload)
If you need to upload files from your `local machine` to the `server`.
* `WSL` & `VPS`: Drag & Drop option.

**`GPU servers (.eg, Hyperbolic)`:**

1- Connect to your GPU server using sFTP

2- Upload Files Using the `put` Command:

In SFTP, the put command uploads files from your local machine to the server. 
```bash
put swarm.pem /home/ubuntu/rl-swarm/swarm.pem
```

# Update Node
### 1- Stop Node
```console
# list screens
screen -ls

# kill swarm screens (replace screen-id)
screen -XS screen-id quit

# You can kill by name
screen -XS swarm quit
```

### 2- Update Node Repository
**Method 1** (test this first): If you cloned official repo with no local changes:
```bash
cd rl-swarm
git pull
```

**Method 2**: If you cloned official repo with local Changes:
```console
cl rl-swarm

# Reset local changes:
git reset --hard
# Pull updates:
git pull

# Alternatively:
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/main
```
* You have to do your local changes again.

**Method 3**: Cloned unofficial repo or Try from scratch (**Recommended**):
```console
cd rl-swarm

# backup .pem
cp ./swarm.pem ~/swarm.pem

cd ..

# delete rl-swarm dir
rm -rf rl-swarm

# clone new repo
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm

cd rl-swarm

# Recover .pem
cp ~/swarm.pem ./swarm.pem
```
* If you had any local changes, you have to do it again.

### 3- Re-run Node
Head back to [4) Run the swarm](https://github.com/0xmoei/gensyn-ai/edit/main/README.md#4-run-the-swarm) and re-run Node.

# Troubleshooting:

### ⚠️ Error: PS1 unbound variable
```
sed -i '1i # ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.\n\n# If not running interactively, don'\''t do anything\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n    *) return;;\nesac\n' ~/.bashrc
```

### ⚠️ Daemon failed to start in 15.0 seconds
* Enter `rl-swarm` directory:
```bash
cd rl-swarm
```
* Activate python venv:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
* Open Daemon config file:
```
nano $(python3 -c "import hivemind.p2p.p2p_daemon as m; print(m.__file__)")
```
* Search for line: `startup_timeout: float = 15`, then change `15` to `120` to increate the Daemon's timeout. the line should look like this: `startup_timeout: float = 120`
* To save the file: Press `Ctrl + X`, `Y` & `Enter`
